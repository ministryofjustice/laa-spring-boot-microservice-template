### ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️
This template is still under development and features may be added or subject to change.

## Overview

Template GitHub repository used for Spring Boot Java microservice projects.

The project uses the `laa-spring-boot-gradle-plugin` Gradle plugin which provides
sensible defaults for the following plugins:

- [Checkstyle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html)
- [Dependency Management](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.spring.dependency-management)
- [Jacoco](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html)
- [Java](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html)
- [Maven Publish](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html)
- [Spring Boot](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.springframework.boot)
- [Test Logger](https://github.com/radarsh/gradle-test-logger-plugin)
- [Versions](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin)

The plugin is provided by -  [laa-spring-boot-common](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-spring-boot-common), where you can find
more information regarding setup and usage.

### Project Structure
Includes the following subprojects:

- `spring-boot-microservice-api` - example OpenAPI specification used for generating API stub interfaces and documentation.
- `spring-boot-microservice-service` - example REST API service with CRUD operations interfacing a JPA repository with an in-memory database.

## Setup Instructions
Once you've created your repository using this template, perform the following steps:

### Update README
Edit this `README.md` file to document your project accurately. Take the time to create a clear, engaging, and informative`README.md` file. Include information such as what your project does, how to install and run it, how to contribute, and any other pertinent details.

### Update Repository Description
Change the description that appears at the top of your repository's main page to provide an overview of your project.

### Grant Team Permissions
Assign permissions to the appropriate Ministry of Justice teams. Ensure at least one team is granted Admin permissions. Whenever possible, assign permissions to teams rather than individual users.

### Add Branch Protection rules
Ensure branch protection is set up on the `main` branch.

### Update CODEOWNERS
(Optional) Modify the `CODEOWNERS` file to specify the teams or users authorized to approve pull requests.

### Configure Dependabot
Change all `uk.gov.laa.springboot.microservice.*` package references to `uk.gov.laa.{application-package-name}.*`.

Uncomment the `registries` section and follow the instructions in the comments.

### Add Repository To Snyk
Ensure that your repository has been added to the [Legal Aid Agency Snyk](https://app.snyk.io/org/legal-aid-agency) organisation.

Also add `SNYK_TOKEN` as a repository secret.

### Update Project Files
<details>

<summary>Click here for more details on which files to update.</summary>

#### 1. Rename subproject directories
Ensure to rename `spring-boot-microservice-api` and `spring-boot-microservice-service` directories to your application name:
`{application-name}-api` and `{application-name}-service`.

Update `settings.gradle` as follows:
```
rootProject.name = '{repository-name}'

include '{application-name}-api'
include '{application-name}-service'
```

Update `build.gradle` in the project root directory as follows:
```
subprojects {
    group = 'uk.gov.justice.laa.{application-name}'
}
```

#### 2. Update api subproject
Update the following files found in the `{application-name}-api` directory:

- `open-api-specification.yml` - replace the contents of this file with the API specification for your application.
- `build.gradle` - replace all references to `spring-boot-microservice-api` with `{service-name}-api`.

#### 3. Update service subproject

Rename the package name/directory - `uk.gov.justice.laa.springboot.microservice` to `uk.gov.justice.laa.{application-package-name}`
under `src/integrationTest/java`, `src/main/java`, `src/test/java`.

Update the following properties in `src/main/resources/application.yml` with your application details:
`spring.application.name`, `info.app.name`, `info.app.description`

#### 4. Update Dockerfile
Rename the `laa-spring-boot-microservice` directory and jar file name to  `laa-{application-name}`.

#### 5. Update GitHub workflow
The following workflows have been provided:

* Build and test PR - `build-test-pr.yml`
* Build and deploy after PR merged - `pr-merge-main.yml` 

In the above workflow files, change all occurrences of the `spring-boot-microservice-service/build/` build path to `{application-name}-service/build/`.

</details>

### Database scripts
The *.sql scripts in  `src/main/resources` have been included to provide an example database for demonstration purposes only and should be removed for your application.

## Build And Run Application

### Build application
`./gradlew clean build`

### Run integration tests
`./gradlew integrationTest`

### Run application
`./gradlew bootRun`

### Run application via Docker
`docker compose up`

## Application Endpoints

### API Documentation

#### Swagger UI
- http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
#### API docs (JSON)
- http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs

### Actuator Endpoints
The following actuator endpoints have been configured:
- http://localhost:8080/actuator
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

## Additional Information

### Libraries Used
- [Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/index.html) - used to provide various endpoints to help monitor the application, such as view application health and information.
- [Spring Boot Web](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/index.html) - used to provide features for building the REST API implementation.
- [Spring Data JPA](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/jpa.html) - used to simplify database access and interaction, by providing an abstraction over persistence technologies, to help reduce boilerplate code.
- [Springdoc OpenAPI](https://springdoc.org/) - used to generate OpenAPI documentation. It automatically generates Swagger UI, JSON documentation based on your Spring REST APIs.
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - used to help to reduce boilerplate Java code by automatically generating common
  methods like getters, setters, constructors etc. at compile-time using annotations.
- [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/) - used for object mapping, specifically for converting between different Java object types, such as Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
  and Entity objects. It generates mapping code at compile code.
- [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) - used to provide an example database and should not be used in production.
